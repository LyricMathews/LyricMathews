>>>> Assignment 1- Character creation
The very start of my time in programming, this is to show how far I've come.
even if it was a little hard at the start.

>>>> Assignment 2- Composition Creator
This one was tricky because my computer couldn't handle it,
leaving me to use the building's computers. Worked much better.

>>>>> Assignment 3- Code converter
Also a little difficult for me when I first started using it.
I mainly just need to go back and retrace my steps. 

>>>> Assignment 4- Flowchart Twine demo
This one was actually kinda fun to do,
I like that I can add my humor into it lol.
